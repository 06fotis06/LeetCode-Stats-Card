He would generate the SVG card for you if you tell him the `data` and `parameters`.

### leetcode.js
She asks `LeetCode.com `for the `data` you want.

### style.js
She is taking responsibility for what the SVG card would look like.

### img.js

### extension.js
Intern. He has a lot of great ideas, but still just ideas.
